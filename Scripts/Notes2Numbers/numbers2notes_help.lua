RHYTHMIC NOTATION - BARS -------------------------------------------

FULL BAR
1              (full bar of 1)
 
SPLIT BAR
[1 4]          (two beats of 1 and 2 beats of 4)   
     
SPLIT BAR WITH REST
[1 r]          (two beats of 1 and 2 beats of rest)

MULTI BARS
4[5]           (four bars of 5)
2[1 4 1]       (two bars comprising three whole note triplets) 

UNEVEN SPLIT BARS 
[2(1) 4 5]     (two beats of 1, a beat of 4, and a beat of 5)
[3m 2(6m) 5]   (one beat of 3m, two beats of 6m, and a beat of 5)
[3(1) 5(6m)]   (3 eighth notes of 1, 5 eighth notes of 6m)

EVEN SEPTUPLET SPLIT BAR
[5 1 4 b7 b3 b6 b2]

RHYTHMIC NOTATION - PUSHES -------------------------------------------

<		Eighth note push - (half beat) early
				Following chord will be an eighth note early.
				
<<		Sixteenth note push - (quarter beat) early
				Following chord will be a sixteenth note early.

Example 		1	<2m   =    3 1/2 Beats of 1 and 4 1/2 Beats of 2m. 

Be careful using the pushes!!!!!!  
Do not "borrow" more from the previous chord than it's value.

For example this rhythm will cause a crash or at least an error.

[ 1  2m  3m  (4  5)]   <6m

Why? 
Because this indicates you want the 5 and 6m to happen at the same time.

RHYTHMIC NOTATION - BEATS -------------------------------------------

SPLIT BEAT
(1 2m)         (Two eighths - 1/2 beat of 1 and 1/2 beat of 2m)

SPLIT BEAT WITH REST 
(6m7 r)        (Eighth note of 6m7 and eighth rest)

SPLIT BEAT 
(1 5 4)        (Triplet split) 
               (1/3 beat of 1, 1/3 beat of 5, 1/3 beat of 4)

UNEVEN SPLIT BEAT 
(2(1) 4)       (2/3 beat of 1, and 1/3 beat of 4)

RHYTHMIC NOTATION - SUBDIVISIONS OF THE BEAT ------------------------
       
SPLIT BEAT WITH SUBDIVISIONS
(1 (2m 1 2m))  (eighth note of 1, 16th note triplets on 2m, 1, and 2m)
